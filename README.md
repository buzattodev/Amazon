# Amazon

  Here's my copy of the Amazon's home page. It's part of my practice in HTML and CSS with some responsive page.
  I recently started learning flexbox and tried to test how far goes my knowledge.

<div align="center">
  <img src="![amazon preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83242893/162581981-0f055d3c-b48d-4afb-b5b1-f77fb1ec032f.PNG)" width="900px" />
</div>
